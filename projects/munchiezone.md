summary: A project to help hungry University of Hawaii students.
---

## Overview 
Munchie Zone is a website developed to benefit hungry University of Hawaii students. It allows students to place orders for delivery from restaurants and join pre existing orders as well. By joining orders, students are able to split the delivery fee amongst themselves, thus lowering the overall cost of their order. From the homepage, students can see orders that they have made as well as current orders being placed at their favorite restaurants. From the current orders page, students are also able to sort through current orders by filtering them by restaurant. Orders are also labeled with different tags for those who have alternative diets such as vegetarians, vegans, and gluten free. Finally, orders also have time limits. The creator of the order can input a time people must order by as well as the time and place to pick up the order. 

## My Role
The work in this project was split fairly evenly. In milestone 1, I was in charge of creating mockup pages for the current orders page and the profile page. This involved using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Semantic UI in order to create aesthetically pleasing pages. For the second milestone, I was in charge of implementing a collection of orders that could be viewed from both the current orders page as well as the home page. This was difficult, as it was my first time working with databases on my own. I also implemented a collection of restaurants, which could be used to sort through orders. Finally, I was also in charge of the order joining page, in which students could join in on other people’s orders. As a team, everyone worked on the documentation. We also helped each other whenever one of us was stuck on how to implement something or get rid of a bug.

## A Learning Experience
This project was my first time collaborating with multiple people. I learned many skills, with the most important one being effective communication. This skill was important and was used in a variety of ways. For example, conflict management taught me how to communicate and compromise with my group members. In addition, I improved my leadership skills by helping to delegate tasks to my group members using Issue Driven Management practices. 

From a more technical side, I gained more experience with HTML and Javascript. I also got more experience with Meteor and databases using MongoDB. I was also reminded about the importance of coding standards. Whenever a group member needed help, following the same coding standards made it easier for me to read and understand other people’s code. I also improved my critical thinking skills, which were extremely important when trying to fix bugs in the code. Overall, this project was an excellent learning experience and taught me many skills that I plan on building on throughout my computer science career.
