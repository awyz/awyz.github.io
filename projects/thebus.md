  For this project, I was hired as an independent contractor by The Bus to help move the Oahu Transit Service's Employee Federal Credit Union (OTSEFCU) onto a new host. While on the old hosting service, the OTSEFCU website was written with php. The new host, however, only took HTML, which required me to update parts of the code. 
  
  While I had the help of a more senior programmer, I was in charge with converting the php code into HTML. In addition, I was also in charge of debugging faulty code. 
  
  This project was my first time working for someone. While doing this project, not only did I learn more about the structure of a website and how to create a web page, I also learned the importance of time management and how to communicate effectively with my client. Furthermore, I also got first hand experience with Microsoft SQL as well as data bases.
