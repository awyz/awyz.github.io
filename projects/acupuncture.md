This was my first time building a website from scratch as I was asked to build one for a family friend’s acupuncture practice. She had wanted the website to not only be advertisement for her practice, but it was meant to be informative as well and provide an easy method for potential clients to correspond with her.

Overall, I was responsible for writing and debugging the website’s code. Whenever I was stuck on a particular issue, however, I had the assistance of a more senior programmer who was able to give me advice and help me debug when I needed it.

At the time, I did not have any prior experience with HTML or CSS. Thus, this project was quite the learning experience. With the experience this project gave me, I gained a deeper understand of how different coding languages—in this case HTML and CSS—work together to create a fully-fledged program. I also learned how to ask good questions that would enable the client to tell me exactly what she pictured her website to look like.
