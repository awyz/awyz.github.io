This was my first time building a website from scratch as I was asked to build one for a family friend’s acupuncture practice. She had wanted the website to not only be advertisement for her practice, but to be informative and provide an easy method for potential clients to correspond with her as well.

Overall, I was responsible for writing and debugging the website’s code from scratch. This posed a challenge to me, as I had little to no experience in web development prior. Whenever I was stuck on a particular issue, however, I had the assistance of a more senior programmer who was able to give me advice and help me debug when I needed it. 

At the time, I did not have any experience with HTML or CSS. Thus, this project was quite the learning experience. With the experience this project gave me, I gained a deeper understand of how different coding languages—in this case HTML and CSS—work together to create a fully-fledged program. I also learned how to ask good questions that would enable the client to tell me exactly what she pictured her website to look like.
