CHANGE THE DATE LOL

This was my first time building a website from scratch. A FAMILY FRIEND tasked me  with building a website for her acupuncture practice. In this website, she requested TABS.

Overall, I was responsible for writing the code that built the website and debugging said code. Whenever I was stuck on a particular issue, however, I had the assistance of a more senior programmer who was able to give me advice and help me debug when I required assistance.
  
At the time, I did not have any prior experience with HTML or CSS. Thus, this project was quite the learning experience. After all, reading documentation is one thing, while actually implementing code and debugging is a whole nother thing. With the experience this project gave me, I gained a deeper understand of how different coding languages—in this case HTML and CSS—work together to create a fully-fledged program. I also learned how to ask good questions that would enable the client to tell me exactly what she pictured her website to look like.
