summary: A website I worked on for a client. 
---

This was my first time building a website from scratch as I was asked to build a website for a family friend’s acupuncture practice. 
Overall, I was responsible for writing and debugging the website’s code. Whenever I was stuck on a particular issue, however, I had the assistance of a more senior programmer who was able to give me advice and help me debug when I needed it.

At the time, I did not have any prior experience with HTML or CSS. Thus, this project was quite the learning experience. With the experience this project gave me, I gained a deeper understand of how different coding languages—in this case HTML and CSS—work together to create a fully-fledged program. I also learned how to ask good questions that would enable the client to tell me exactly what she pictured her website to look like.
