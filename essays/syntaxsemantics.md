## UI Frameworks

Bootstrap. Foundation. Semantic UI. While UI frameworks definitely come with their own learning curve, overall they alleviate some of the pain associated with web development. Plain text websites look, as their name implies, quite plain, but take a UI Framework such as Semantic UI for example: not only is it relatively easy to use in comparison to raw HTML/CSS, to put it plainly, it looks much, much nicer as well with a lot less effort. Even novices at web development--such as myself--are able to create aesthetically pleasing sites. This is mainly because of Semantic UI’s built in classes that are easy to customize, easy to use, and rather intuitive, for instance: implementing a menu is as simple as “ui menu”. To invert its colors, one merely has to insert the word “inverted” somewhere in the class name. 

Semantic UI also has clear, easy to read documentation filled with examples and source code. With a plain website built with HTML/CSS, one has to fiddle with the code so it looks nice for different types of devices. However, Semantic UI automatically creates different versions of one’s website that can be accessed by laptops, desktops, mobile devices, and tablets in a pleasing manner without any extra work on the developer’s part. As someone who is very much still learning the ins and outs of web development, this is very helpful.

## My Experiences

When I first started learning how to create websites, it took eons to build my first website in HTML and CSS. Though I was proud that I had finished my first real project, I had to face the ugly truth: despite all the time and energy I poured into my website, it was hideous as hideous gets. Compare that to today where, thanks to the help of Semantic UI, I am able to code nicer and more professional websites in the blink of an eye. In my opinion, one of the best features of Semantic UI is how easy it was for me to pick up due to its intuitive nature, unlike HTML and CSS which had me googling how to implement something every twenty seconds. Thus, I believe that Semantic UI is a useful tool for professionals and beginners alike.
