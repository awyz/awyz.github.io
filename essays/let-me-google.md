Some would characterize computer scientists as antisocial fellows who spend more time fiddling with computers instead of speaking to other human beings. This, however, is not true. In fact, effective communication skills is one of the most important abilities a young, hopeful computer programmer can learn.

Many students have been taught this. However, in the world of computer science, this statement is less than true. While it is important to ask questions and get help when stuck on a problem, knowing how to ask the question the smart way is paramount. According to Eric Raymond’s essay “How To Ask Questions The Smart Way”, asking to-the-point questions, being specific and precise about the issue at hand, using proper English, and doing background research before posing a questions helps not only the question asker, but those answering the questions as well. For example, in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26355645/error-in-launching-avd-with-amd-processor">this question</a>, the original poster has asked their question in a precise manner with no fluff. By exactly describing the error they were experiencing, their computer specifications, and what they have already done to try fix the error, they demonstrate that they knew how to ask questions and were willing to put SOME WORK IN(???). Furthermore, by doing this, those answering the question had an exact idea of what was wrong and what the original poster had already done to try fix the problem, the repliers were able to give multiple quality answers.

On the other hand, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12155470/date-picker-noob"> this question</a> was not asked in a smart way. For one, this questioner posed the same question 3 separate times on Stack Overflow. In addition, the poster did not do any research prior to asking the question and spent most of the post self-flagellating. By not following the conventions of good question asking as detailed by Raymond, the poster received very few answers applicable to their situation and most likely drove other possible replies away. In fact, most of the responses were about the poster’s lack of prior research or about how they should not have posted the same question multiple times. 

As a student, I am well aware that I still have much to learn, especially in the communications department. Prior to reading “How To Ask Questions The Smart Way”, I did not even realize that there were good and bad ways to ask for help. However, now that I know what is and is not proper, I feel more confident not only asking questions, but communicating with other computer scientists in the ICS community as well.
