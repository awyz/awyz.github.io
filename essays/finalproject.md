Overview
The problem: Food delivery companies such as BiteSquad and UberEats charge extra for delivery if the price of the food does not reach a minimum.  

The solution: This app would allows UH students to communicate with other students in the same predicament to order food without having to deal with the extra charges. On this app, students would be able to see any delivery orders being made on campus and could join in the order by adding their own food items. 

Mockup Page Ideas:
* Home page
* Login page
* User profile page
* Order requests page (will include a map that shows the orders closest to the user)

Use Case Ideas
* User goes to the home page and logs in on the login page.
* User is taken to the order requests/map page so they can see the orders closest to them.
* Users are notified if a request opens up at a restaurant that they have favorited.

Beyond the Basics
* Automatic updating of requests
* Map function that shows restaurants who have a delivery system
* Users can rate the delivery company's service
