Overview
The problem: Food delivery companies such as BiteSquad and UberEats charge extra for delivery if the price of the food does not reach a minimum.  

The solution: This app would allows UH students to communicate with other students in the same predicament to order food without having to deal with the extra charges. On this app, students would be able to see any delivery orders being made on campus and could join in the order by adding their own food items. Users will determine payment methods amongst themselves.

Mockup Page Ideas:
* Home page
* Login page
* User profile page
* Order requests page 
* About page that teaches users how to use the site

Use Case Ideas
* User goes to the home page and logs in on the login page.
* Users can go to their profile to mark their favorite restaurants/dietary needs
* User is taken to the order requests/map page so they can see the orders closest to them.
* Users are notified if a request opens up at a restaurant that they have favorited.
* Users can place an order or join orders on the order request page
* Users are notified of the meeting place after placing an order/joining an order

Beyond the Basics
* Automatic updating of requests
* Map function that shows restaurants who have a delivery system
* Map function that shows orders closest to them
* Users can rate the delivery company's service
* Users can rate other users based on their reliability
