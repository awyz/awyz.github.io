<h3>The Past</h3>

In terms of programming experience, I still consider myself a newbie. While I have experience with Java, C, and some C++, Javascript is a whole different beast to tackle. Unlike C or Java, Javascript feels more flexible in comparison to Java and C, for example: Java and C both require the programmer to specify what data type is being returned from a function and also what data types any passed in parameters are. This, however, does not occur in Javascript, where various different data types can be returned by one function. From a software engineering perspective, I believe that Javascript is a good programming language as it allows programmers to have more freedom when, for example, they are building functions that are meant to be used multiple ways.

<h3>The Present</h3>

At the beginning of the semester, the concept of athletic software engineering was completely new to me. At first, I was intimidated. The concept of coding under what seemed like a relatively short time limit was daunting. However, after doing the practice WODS, I definitely feel that the practice WODS are great at helping get rid of any programming jitters. In addition, the practice WODS let me to see where my programming strengths and weaknesses lie, allowing me to spend more time understanding how I can improve as a programmer.

<h3>The Future</h3>

Although this athletic software engineering style of learning is a bit stressful because of the time limit, I feel that it will benefit me in the future, especially during the coding portion of job interviews. Overall, however, I feel like this is an enjoyable way to learn as it forces students take a look at how comfortable they are with coding. In addition, I find that the athletic software engineering is a refreshing change of pace from the usual “lecture in class and occasionally take a test” format that many other classes follow. In some ways, doing practice and official WODS can be fun, especially when you have a peer to compete against to see who had the better time. Therefore, I wholeheartedly believe that this teaching style will work very well for me.
