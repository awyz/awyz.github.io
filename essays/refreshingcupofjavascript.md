<h3>My Experiences</h3>

In terms of programming experience, I still consider myself a newbie. While I have experience with Java, C, and some C++, Javascript is a whole different beast to tackle. Unlike C or Java, Javascript feels more flexible in comparison. For example, Java and C both require the programmer to specify what data type is being returned from a function and also the data types of all passed in parameters. This, however, does not occur in Javascript, where various different data types can be returned by one function. In fact, it is because of this flexibility that I believe that Javascript is a good programming language. It allows programmers to have more freedom when, for example, they are building functions that are meant to be used multiple ways.

<h3>Practice Makes Permanent</h3>

At the beginning of the semester, athletic software engineering was completely new to me. At first, I was intimidated. The concept of coding under what seemed like a relatively short time limit was daunting. However, after doing the practice WODS, I definitely feel that they are great at helping get rid of any programming jitters. In addition, the practice WODS let me see where my programming strengths and weaknesses lie, allowing me to spend more time understanding how I can improve as a programmer.

<h3>Getting Fit With Athletic Software Engineering</h3>

Although this athletic software engineering style of learning is a bit stressful because of the time limit, I feel that it will benefit me in the future, especially when I need to work under pressure. Overall, however, I feel like this is an enjoyable way to learn as it forces students to take a look at how comfortable they are with coding. In addition, I find that the athletic software engineering is a refreshing change of pace from the usual “lecture in class and occasionally take a test” format that many other classes follow. In some ways, doing practice and official WODS can be fun, especially when you have a peer to compete against to see who had the better time. Therefore, I wholeheartedly believe that this teaching style will work very well for me.
