Coding standards. Who needs them, right? All they do is waste time and give programmer’s a headache.

What’s so great about coding standards? For one, they show a certain level of professionalism. Instead of being a button pressing monkey, one shows that they have put time and effort into their code in order to make it more readable. It also shows that the programmer is comfortable with the language they are writing in, as they not only are able to program in that language, but know how to correctly format their code in order for it to be readable.

Secondly, with messy code the original programmer may be able to quickly read and understand their own code, however fellow teammates and other programmers may struggle to understand what the code intends to do. Not only will it take a few extra seconds, minutes, or hours to understand the messy code, but it shows a lack of concern for one’s collaborators as well. This is especially problematic, as in the computer science industry being able to communicate and work successfully and efficiently with one’s peers is extremely important. 

Fortunately, there are tools for newbies and experts alike that help check one’s code and ensure that it is “up to snuff”. Take ESlint, a very thorough style checker, for example. While it may seem picky, tools such as ESLint are able to check that the code’s style is correct down to ensuring one has enough spaces in their code. While it can be frustrating and at times even painful combing through one’s code and slowly chipping away at the errors and warnings ESLint provides, it is satisfying to know that not only I have a written a program that (hopefully) works, but I have written a program that is easy to read and is aesthetically pleasing.
