Meteor. Not only is it a flying rock in outer space, but it is a enormously helpful tool in web development. Unfortunately, with great power comes great responsibility, and Meteor along with it's partner MongoDB definitely have a steep learning curve. As I learned how to use Meteor and became more familiar with it, I encountered many different problems. 

One reoccurring problem occurred when my pages and files refused to appear my website. When I first encountered this problem, it took me eons to try and figure out what was wrong. Was my syntax off? Had I accidentally deleted something important? Did technology have some sort of twisted, lifelong grudge against me? Fortunately, it was none of the above. With time and the help of my professor's lectures, I soon realized that my problem was simple: I had forgotten to import my pages in my index files. From this mistake I learned one thing: if a page element is not appearing, it probably has not yet been imported. Definitely a D'OH moment.

Although I found success with the previous problem, there was another, related problem that I failed to fix despite my intense Google-fu-ing sessions. At times when I tried to import certain files, my Meteor would immediately crash, for example: I had recently tried to create a website that displayed contact information for several people. This information was contained within a .js file while the home page itself was contained in an html file. However, whenever I tried to include my .js file, I was met with a series of errors and a crashed Meteor. The error message would say that a different .js files could not be found. 

Alas, although I still have not solved the second problem, I know that learning how to use Meteor is a skill, and with practice comes skills. I am confident that as I become more familiar and comfortable with how Meteor works and practice more with it, I will be able to figure out why on Earth my Meteor refuses to play nice.
