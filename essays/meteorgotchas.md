Meteor. Not only is it a flying rock in outerspace, but it is a enormously helpful tool in web development. Unfortunately, with great power comes great responsibility, and Meteor--along with it's partner MongoDB--definitely has a steep learning curve. As I learned how to use Meteor and became more familiar with it, I encountered endless amounts of problems.

One reoccurring problem was when my pages and files refused to show up my website. When I first encountered this problem, it took me eons to try and figure out what was wrong. Was my syntax off? Did I leave out an important file? Had I accidentally deleted something important? With time and the help of my professor's lectures, I soon realized that my problem was simple: I had forgotten to import my pages in my index files. 

Despite my success with the previous problem, there was another problem that I failed to fix despite my intense Google-fu-ing sessions. At times when I tried to import certain files, my Meteor would immediately crash, for example: I had recently tried to create a website that displayed contact information for several people. This information was contained within a .js file. However, whenever I tried to include my .js file, I was met with a series of errors and a crashed Meteor. 

Although I still have not solved the second problem, I know that learning how to use Meteor is a skill. I am confident that as I become more familiar and comfortable with how Meteor works and using it, I will be able to figure out why on Earth my Meteor seems to have a grudge against me.
