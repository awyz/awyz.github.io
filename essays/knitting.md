<h3>A Sweater of Code</h3>

 I am metaphorically banging my head against the wall, trying to think of the best way to describe programming to a coworker with no computer science experience in a way that she will understand. So far, “typing commands in a computer language” is out, and so is “writing in a way the computer can understand”. Bam. It hits me. Software engineering is like knitting. While programming lacks the long needles and balls of yarn characteristic of knitting, the two have more in common than one would think. Just like knitting, going free fall and following one’s heart is one way to produce a final product--whether it be a comfy, cozy sweater or a full fledged program. However, it would be much more time and effort efficient to use a pre-existing pattern. In computer science, these patterns are called design patterns. Design patterns are solutions to problems that are general enough to be applied to common issues. For example, in the eyes of a knitter, a problem could be wanting to make a sweater, but having no idea how. A solution to this problem would be to use a pattern. 
<h3>A More Complex Product</h3>

I have used several design patterns within my own code, sometimes without realizing it. For example, Private Class Data design has been woven into several of my programs as a way to control who has access to data belonging to certain classes or objects via getters and setters. In addition, the Null Object design pattern has also been of great help in situations where I want to either initialize something as a null object or am checking to see if an object exists. Also, the iterator design has been particularly useful. For example, I have used it to access data stored in lists by iterating over all the elements.

While these design patterns may seem rather simple, much like knitting, together these patterns can be combined and used to make more complex products. Without them, programming--for newbies especially--would involve a lot more confusion, effort, and needles poking eyes.
